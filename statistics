Guidelines to conduct statistical studies
-state hypothesis
-identify the individual of interest
-identify the variables to check
-choose if you will use  whole population or sample and if sample choose a sampling method
-ethical concern eg sensitive questions
-collect data
-use descriptive of inferencial statistics to answer your hypothesis
-note any concern about your analysis


sampling methods 
-simple random sampling
-stratified sampling 
-cluster sampling
-systematic sampling
-convinience(limited resources or low risk question)
-multi -stage sampling {combining the above sampling methods}

There is experimental studies and observational studies
-experimental implies the variables are administered purposely while observational is watching the effects as they happen to the sample.
studies must be done rigorously enough for science to progress.
